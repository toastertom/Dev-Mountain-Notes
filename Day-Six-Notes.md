## JavaScript

* How to link JavaScript to your html document. **Note: Always link your JavaScript files at the very end of your html <body>!!**
```
<script src="scripts.js"></script>
              or
<script src="http:// example.com/scripts.js"></script>

</body>
```
* **Document Object Model (DOM)** Think of it as a staging area before the web app is rendered on the screen.
